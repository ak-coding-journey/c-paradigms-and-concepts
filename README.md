# c-paradigms-and-concepts
This repository contains a set of beginner‑friendly C programs designed to demonstrate fundamental programming paradigms and concepts through sequential execution. The focus is on clarity, readability, and practical application of formulas and logic, with outputs neatly formatted using \n\n for separation.
# C Paradigms and Concepts

This repository contains a single sequential C program that demonstrates fundamental programming paradigms and concepts. The program combines multiple assignments into one run, with outputs formatted using `\n\n` for clarity. It is designed for students learning **Programming Paradigms & Concepts Using C**.

## Included Problems
- **Q15:** Accept a character between B and Y, then display its next and previous character.  
- **Q16:** Accept dimensions of a cylinder and calculate its surface area and volume.  
- **Q17:** Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.  
- **Q18:** Accept inner and outer radius of a ring, then calculate its perimeter and area.  

## Key Features
- Written in **C language** with simple, structured code.  
- Demonstrates **sequential programming** (no loops, no menus).  
- Clean output formatting with `\n\n` for readability.  
- Error handling included (e.g., outer radius must be greater than inner radius).  
- All problems solved in a single execution.  

## Usage
Compile and run the program:
```bash
gcc sequential_programs.c -o sequential_programs
./sequential_programs
